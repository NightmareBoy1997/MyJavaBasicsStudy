The Dreamer

Go with your passion.It has been said that who see the invisible can do the impossible.

When I was nine years old living in a smaIl town in North Carolina I found an ad for selling greeting cards in the back of a children's magazine£ÆI thought to myself I can do this£ÆI begged my mother to let me send for the kit£ÆTwo weeks later when the kit arrived£¨I ripped off the brown paper wrapper£¨grabbed the cards and dashed from the house£ÆThree hours later£ÆI returned home with no card and a pocket full of money proclaiming£¨°∞Mama£Æall the people couldn't wait to buy my cards£°°±A salesperson was born£Æwhen I was twelve years old£¨my father took me to see Zig Ziegler£ÆI remember sitting in that dark auditorium listening to Mr£¨Zigler raise everyone's spirits up to the ceiling£¨I left there feeling like I could do anything£ÆWhen we got to the car£¨I turned to my father and said£Æ°∞Dad£ÆI want to make people feel like that£Æ°±My father asked me what I meant£Æ"I want to be a motivational speaker just like Mr£ÆZigler£¨°∞I replied£ÆA dream was born£Æ

Recently£¨I began pursuing my dream of motivating others£ÆAfter a four-year relationship with a major furtune 100company beginning as a salestrainer and ending as a regional sales manager£¨I left the company at the height of my career£¨Many people were astounded that I would leave after earning a six-figure income£ÆAnd they asked why I would risk everything for a dream£Æ

I made my decision to start my own company and leave my secure position after attending a regional sales meeting£ÆThe vice-president of our company delivered a speech that changed my life£ÆHe asked us,°∞If a genie would grant you three wishes what would they be£ø°±After giving us a moment to write down the three wishes£Æhe then asked us,"why do you need a genie ?"I would never forget the empowerment I felt at that moment£Æ

I realized that everything I had accomplished“ªthe graduate degree£¨the successful sales career£¨speaking engagements£¨training and managing for a fortune l00company had prepared me for this moment£ÆI was ready and did not need a genie's help to become a motivational speaker£Æ

When I tearfully told my boss my plans this incredible leader whom Irespect so much replied,"Precede with reckless abandon and you will be successful°∞

Having made that decision£¨I was immediately tested£ÆOne week after I gave notice£¨my husband was°∞laid off from his job£ÆWe had recently bought a new home and needed both incomes to make the monthly mortgage payment and now we were done to no income£ÆIt was tempting to turn back to my former company£¨knowing they wanted me to stays but l was certain that if I went back£¨I would never leave£ÆI decided I still wanted to move forward rather than end up with a mouth full of°±if onlys"later on£ÆA motivational speaker was born£Æ

When l held fast to my dream£¨even during the tough times£ÆThe miracles really began to happen£ÆIn a short time period my husband found a better job£ÆWe didn't miss a mortgage payment£ÆAnd I was able to book several speaking engagements with new clients£ÆI discovered the incredible power of dreams£ÆI loved my old job,my peers and the company I left£¨but it was time to get on with my dream£ÆTo celebrate my success I had a local artist paint my new offlce as a garden£ÆAt the top of one wall she stenciled,°∞The world always makes way for the dreamer£Æ°±
